# MelodyMaker
  Solo school project where we had to create a bedroom with WebGL using the THREE.js library.

## Requirements 
  Need to be launched with a server such as mamp or wamp in order to be able to load textures locally.

## Features

- Move around with z/q/s/d keys.
- Go up & down with c/v keys. 
- Switch on/off the light and TV with space bar. Be careful, dark places can be scary !
